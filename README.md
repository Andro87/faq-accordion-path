### What I learned

This project is part of the "Introduction to web accessibility" path on the Frontend Mentor platform. It helped me gain a better understanding of the best practices for creating accessible accordion components. The main focus was on how to best structure the code and which elements to use, such as HTML elements and ARIA attributes.
